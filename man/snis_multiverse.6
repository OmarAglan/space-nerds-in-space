.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.warn 511
.PP
snis_multiverse is a meta-server process for the game Space Nerds In Space, which is
a multiplayer starship bridge simulator.  The meta-server process tracks player
ships between instances of the server process.  It is what enables player ships
to travel from one snis_server instance to another, possibly on a different host.
The "gameinstance" parameter is used by the game lobby
process (ssgl_server) to distinguish one game instance from another running
on the same host.
The gameinstance should be a short human readable string to uniquely identify
the game instance.  The serverhost is the hostname of the server hosting the
ssgl_multiverse process.  The location is a human readable string giving some idea
of the location of the server, or some other descriptive information.
.SH Options:
.TP
\fB--acknowledgments\fR
Prints out acknowledgments and license information and exits.
.TP
\fB--allow-remote-networks\fR
By default, snis_server instances started by snis_multiverse will not
allow clients to connect from remote networks, but only from the local
network as determined by the netmask. With this option, snis_multiverse
will invoke snis_server instances with the same --allow-remote-networks
option so that such instances will allow clients to connect from
remote networks.  See also: the environment variable SNIS_ALLOW_REMOTE_NETWORKS
below.
.TP
\fB\--autowrangle, -a\fR
Automatically start snis_server processes within one warp-gate hop
of any player, and automatically shutdown snis_server process not within
one warp gate hop of any player.
.TP
\fB\--exempt, -e\fR
Exempt a snis_server location from autowrangling. If you use autowrangling
you need to exempt at least one snis_server location otherwise snis_multiverse
will immediately shut down all snis_servers since, initially, there are no
connected player ships anywhere.
.TP
\fB\--lobby, -l lobbyserver\fR
Specify the lobby server hostname or IP address.
.TP
\fB\--servernick, -n nickname\fR
Specify the nickname of this multiverse process.
(It's not really used for anything, nevertheless, it's required.)
\fB\--location, -L location\fR
Specify the location of this multiverse process.
(It's not really used for anything, nevertheless, it's required.)
\fB\--version\fR
Print the program's version number and exit.
.TP
.SH FILES
.TP
\fB./snis_multiverse_log.txt\fR
(Only if started via snis_launcher.) This file contains the stdout and
stderr of snis_multiverse, Can be useful for debugging.  This file can
be relocated via the SNIS_LOG_DIR environment variable.
.TP
\fB$SNIS_DB_DIR/snisdb\fR,
.TP
\fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/space-nerds-in-space/snisdb\fR,
.TP
\fB$HOME/.local/share/space-nerds-in-space/snisdb\fR
Directory containing a database of bridge data.  This database is used for verifying
username/passwords for bridges and for storing bridge state to allow bridges to transition
from one snis_server instance to another.

If neither XDG_DATA_HOME nor SNIS_DB_DIR is set, then snisdb is stored in
$HOME/.local/share/space-nerds-in-space.
If the environment variable SNIS_DB_DIR is set, then snisdb is stored in
$SNIS_DB_DIR.
Finally if XDG_DATA_HOME is set, and is an absolute path,
then snisdb is stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/space-nerds-in-space.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
\fBSNIS_ALLOW_REMOTE_NETWORKS\fR
If the value of this environment variable is "1" it has the same effect
as the --allow-remote-networks option.

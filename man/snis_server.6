snis_server is a server process for the game Space Nerds In Space, which is a
multiplayer starship bridge simulator.  The server process simulates the game
universe and processes input data from client processes and sends outputs to
client processes.  The "location" parameter is used to distinguish one game
instance from another running on the same host (multiple snis_server processes
may be run on the same host).  The location should be a short human readable
string to uniquely identify the game instance and is required.  The lobbyhost
is the hostname of the server hosting the ssgl_server process.
.SH Options:
.TP
\fB\--acknowledgments\fR
Prints out acknowledgments and license information and exits.
.TP
\fB\--allow-remote-networks\fR
By default, snis_server will drop connections from any client originating
from a different network, allowing connections only from clients on the
same network, as it is primarily a LAN game.  This option allows clients
to connect from different networks.  There is also a tweakable variable in the
console LOCAL-NET-ONLY, which this option sets to zero.
.TP
\fB\-e, --enable-enscript\fR
Enable the "enscript" command on the Demon screen.  This allows clients to create
files on the server so you should probably leave this off.
.TP
\fB\-l, --lobbyhost\fR
Set the hostname at which the lobbyhost is running.
.TP
\fB\-L, --location\fR
Set the "location" to be used with the lobby server.  This is just
and arbitrary string for human consumption to differentiate one gameserver
from another.  It is required.
.TP
\fB\-m, --multiverse location\fR
Set the 'location' of the snis_multiverse server to connect to.  snis_server
will monitor the lobby looking for entries with game type of 'SNIS-MVERSE'
(i.e. for instances of snis_multiverse) and with the location field set to
the value specified by the --multiverse option.
.TP
\fB\-v, --version\fR
Print the program's version number and exit.
.SH FILES
.PP
/dev/input/js0, the joystick device node.
.PP
/dev/input/event5, the rumble effect device. 
.PP
/usr/share/snis/sounds/*.ogg contain the audio data used by the game.
.PP
share/snis/luascripts/* -- various lua scripts which may be run to
implement scenarios or missions. The file names of luascripts must
be uppercase -- use ABC.LUA, not abc.lua. One level of subdirectories
is allowed -- XXX/ABC.LUA is permitted, but not XXX/YYY/ABC.LUA.
If multiple subdirectories contain scripts with the same name, the
first script encountered is executed.  That is to say, if you have
A.LUA, X/A.LUA, Y/A.LUA, Z/A.LUA, and you execute "a" from the demon
screen, A.LUA will be executed. If A.LUA didn't exist, then X/A.LUA
would be executed.  You can differentate by typing, e.g. "z/a" on
the demon screen to execute Z/A.LUA.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
SNISRAND can be set to a random seed to affect universe generation
.PP
SNISSERVERPORT can be used to control the port on which snis_server listens
for new connections.  If not set, a random port number is used which clients
discover via ssgl_server.  If set, the given port number is used (and clients
still discover it via ssgl_server.)
.PP
SNISSERVERNOLOBBY if this is defined the server will not attempt to connect to
the lobby server process "ssgl_server".  Generally SNISSERVERPORT should be used
when SNISSERVERNOLOBBY is used (otherwise you'll have to figure out which port
snis_server is using via e.g. examining output of "netstat -na").
.PP
SNIS_ASSET_DIR can cause the program to use a different directory to read
various assets (models, sounds, etc.) from a different directory allowing
easy substitution of all art assets.   Default is to use share/snis.
.PP
SNIS_SERVER_PORT_RANGE can cause the program to choose random ports in
the specified range MIN:MAX where MIN must be greater than 1024 and MAX
must be less than or equal to 65335.  This can be useful for restricting
the range of port numbers to those which a firewall configuration might
permit.  Default values are a minimum of 49151 and a maximum of 65335.

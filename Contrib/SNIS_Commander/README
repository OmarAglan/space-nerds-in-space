SNIS_Commander:

In a python virtualenv with voila available you can:

 voila --debug --Voila.ip=0.0.0.0 --port 9996 ./SNIS_Commander.ipynb

which will serve a very rudimentary web application with a simple form which sends
commands to "ship" (natural-language-fifo), "game" (demon mode) and messages which
will be read by the computer (text-to-speech)

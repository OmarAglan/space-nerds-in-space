The Contrib directory is meant to contain things contributed by others
which aren't necessary to run Space Nerds in Space, and which in
some sense aren't a part of the core of the game, but which work
with Space Nerds in Space -- various optional utilities and what not.

Things you find in here might be quite experimental and might not
necessarily be well tested.  They might also be just fine.

Caveat emptor.

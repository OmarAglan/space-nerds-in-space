This document is a brief summary of typical things you need to change to
add a new opcode into the SNIS protocol.

Typically, the opcode is sent from the snis_client to snis_server in response
to some user action, and then snis_server updates some internal data structure
of the player ship (for example) and this data gets mirrored back to the clients
in some way (maybe using the same opcode).

Typically the following things need to be changed:

1.  snis_packet.h: Choose a new opcode value.

2.  Modify snis client/snis server to send/receive the new opcode

3.  Modify snis_opcode_def.c to check the format of the opcode

4.  Modify snis_packet.h if there is a data structure that needs to be updated/added

5.  change SNIS_PROTOCOL_VERSION in snis.h

6.  update snis_entity_key_value_specification.h
	if any data is to be persisted between game runs or across warp gates.

7.  update snis_bridge_update_packet.c and UPDATE_BRIDGE_PACKET_SIZE in snis_bridge_update_packet.h

8.  update doc/snis-protocol.html

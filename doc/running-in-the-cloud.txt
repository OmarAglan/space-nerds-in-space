Note: Space Nerds in Space is designed to run as a LAN game. It might not
work very well over the internet.  However, if you insist, here are some hints.

Building
--------

Building is done in the usual way, except you do not need to build snis_client
on your cloud server (you will only need to build snis_client on your local
machines.)  This also means you do not need many of the dependencies that
snis_client requires to build.  You should only need:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential;
  sudo apt-get install pkg-config;
  sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev;

  git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git

  make bin/snis_server bin/snis_multiverse bin/ssgl_server

You will probably see some complaining about pkg-config this and that. As long as
those 3 binaries build ok, it's probably nothing to worry about. It's just hunting
around for things needed for snis_client, which you're not building.

Firewall configuration and port stuff
-------------------------------------

ssgl_server (the lobby process) usually listens on port 2914. You can either
open that port on your firewall or choose another port.

snis_server port numbers are chosen dynamically.  You can restrict the range
of ports from which the random port numbers will be chosen. This means you
won't have to open up a huge range of port numbers on your firewall.

Lets say you want to run ssgl_server on port 20201, and you want snis_server
to run in the range 20000-20050.

First, make sure those ports are open on your firewall on your cloud system.

	sudo ufw status numbered

Let's say they are not open.  Ok, so you need to open them on your cloud system:

	sudo ufw allow 20201
	sudo ufw allow 20000:20050/tcp

Don't forget to delete these rules you added when you're done playing (see below).

Run snis_launcher on your cloud system:

---- NOTE: Here's a shortcut: You can do:
----
---- export SSGL_PORT=20201
---- export SNIS_SERVER_PORT_RANGE=20000:20050
----
---- and then skip ahead to the section about starting snis processes on the cloud machine

$ ./snis_launcher

     Welcome to Space Nerds In Space

------------------------------------------------------------
No SNIS processes are currently running.
------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Launch SNIS lobby server
	The lobby server allows clients to find servers
	There should be one lobby server total.
   2. Launch SNIS multiverse server
	The multiverse server stores player ship data
	There should be one multiverse server total
   3. Launch SNIS server
	There should be one snis server per solarsystem.
	There should be at least one instance of snis_server.
   4. Launch SNIS client process
	There should be one snis client process per player
	plus one more per ship for the main screen.
   5. Launch limited SNIS client process (no Open GL required).
   6. Stop all SNIS processes
   7. Stop all SNIS clients
   8. Stop all SNIS servers
   9. Check for asset updates
   10. Options
   0. Quit
   Choose [0-10]:

Choose 10, "Options".

     Space Nerds In Space Options

------------------------------------------------------------
No SNIS processes are currently running.
------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Enter Lobby Host IP addr (currently localhost)
    2. Enter Lobby Host Port number (currently not set, will default to gamelobby/2914)
    3. Enter SNIS server port range MIN:MAX (currently not set, will default to IANA dynamic port range)
    0. Return to main menu

Choose 2 and enter your preferred lobby port number (must match your firewall rules).

Enter lobby port: 20201

Then choose 3 and enter your preferred snis server port range (must match your firewall rules):

Enter SNIS server port range (min:max): 20000:20050

     Space Nerds In Space Options

------------------------------------------------------------
No SNIS processes are currently running.
------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Enter Lobby Host IP addr (currently localhost)
    2. Enter Lobby Host Port number (currently 20201)
    3. Enter SNIS server port range MIN:MAX (currently 20000:20050)
    0. Return to main menu
   Choose [0-3]:


Then choose 0 to return to the main menu.


Starting SNIS processes on the cloud machine
--------------------------------------------

If you took the shortcut mentioned above, then run ./snis_launcher now.

Then choose 1, 2, and 3 to start ssgl_server, snis_multiverse, and snis_server.
For snis_multiverse (for now) choose "n" for the autowrangle question.) I had
some trouble when I tried using this due to the OOM killer killing snis_server
instances.  You can try 'y' if you want, but it might not work well.

That's it for the server.

On the local machine to run the client:
---------------------------------------

1. run snis_launcher

2. Choose options

3. Select 2, Enter Lobby Host Port number and enter your preferred lobby port number.

4. Select 0, return to main menu

5. Select 4, to start snis_client

6. Enter the host name or IP address of your cloud machine in the network setup UI.

7. Enter your ship name and password (make them up now if you've never done this before).

8. The first time, make sure 'CREATE SHIP' is checked. Subsequent times, if you are using
   the same ship name and password, make sure 'CREATE SHIP' is not checked.

9. Hit the "Connect to ... " button at the bottom of the screen.

10. You should then be able to select your snis server instance and connect.


Deleting firewall rules when you're done
----------------------------------------

Once you're done, delete the rules you added to your firewall configuration.

	sudo ufw status numbered

(it will show you a numbered list of rules.)

	sudo ufw delete (rule-number)

Note: Delete the rules in reverse order because it will re-number the rules after
each deletion. It will ask you to confirm each rule deletion. Be very careful that
you are deleting the rule you mean to delete and not some other rule. If you delete
for example the rule that allows your ssh session to exist, you will have a bad time.

Also pay attention to v4 and v6 rules, because "ufw allow 20000" will likely add *two*
rules, one for v4 and one for v6 and you almost certainly want to delete them both.

Running a bare snis_server process
----------------------------------

You can also run a bare snis_server process with no ssgl_server lobby or snis_multiverse
at all, but connecting with snis_client becomes a little more cumbersome.

To do this, start snis_server like this:

export SNISSERVERNOLOBBY=1
export SNISSERVERPORT=20000 # or whatever port you want to use
snis_server -n your-name -L your-location

You can put whatever you want for your-name and your-location

To connect with snis_client:

snis_client -s hostname -p portnumber --starship enterprise --pw tribbles --nolobby --no-launcher

You can put whatever you want for "enterprise" and "tribbles"
